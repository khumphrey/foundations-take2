# Welcome to the Foundations Assessment Retake
Read the instructions below for more details on each problem and also how to start and submit your assessment. Good luck!

## Starting/Submission Instructions

### Starting

1. **Important:** Fork this repository to your own Github user account
2. Clone your forked repo to your local machine
3. `npm install`
4. Run `npm test` and load the URL displayed in your terminal.

This works just like the Test First JavaScript exercises that we've done - reverse engineer the test, write code to make the tests pass.

Complete these problems:

- 00_remove - 6.00 Points
- 01_rename_object_properties - 6.00 Points
- 02_get_next - 8.00 Points
- 03_count_deep_keys - 6.00 Points ~ give this problem your best effort, significant partial credit will be credited.  Attempt count_deep_keys last.

Total Points: 26.00

Reminder, **do not alter** any of the TestSpecs unless instructed to. ***All solutions should be written in the empty `.js` files in each folder***.

Each folder has a **README.md** file, **read the README files to get an overview of each Test Spec and Point Value.**

### Submitting

When time is complete or when you finish the code, commit the changes to the git repository using the command: `git commit -am "submitting assessment"`.  After you commit you work, commit your work to your personal fork on Github.
